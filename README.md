# Demonstrator Frontend

The Frontend of the RIESGOS Demonstrator is build up of a lot of open source libraries, mainly
- [Clarity Design System](https://github.com/vmware/clarity/) as the UI framework,
- [OpenLayers](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers) to visualize geospatial data,
- [turfjs](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf) to use geospatial functions on the client side and 
- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) as framework to build the application.
