## Rationale
Natural hazards often consist of multiple, cascading processes (an earthquake causes a tsunami which damages powerlines, ...), whereas scientific models usually try to model just one of these processes at a time.
We exposed several scientific models as WPS and combined them in a simple web-frontend to allow for a more holistic approach to multistep risk-management.


## Background
This website is the frontend for a cloud of webservices. During the RIESGOS-project, a number of scientific models have been exposed by the project-partners using the WPS ([web processing service](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wps)) protocol. This SOAP-protocol describes the in- and outputs to a model. This website serves as a frontend to those models - it aims to:
 - allow the user to set the inputs to a model, trigger its execution and display the models results
 - chain a series of models together to form a scenario that can depict the mulititude of processes that consitute a natural hazard (earthquake + tsunami + infrastructure, volcanic eruption + ashfall + lahar, ...)
 - make it easy for the user to explore the range of effects a natural hazard can have

## Business logic
Our model consists of `processes` and `products`. They form a directed, bipartite graph: each process provides one or more products, which may or may not be the input to another process. We arrange that graph in a linear sequence by running a `toposort` on it. This linear seqence is then displayed in the UI: by arranging the processes in a sequence, we make it easier to guide the user through the chain of steps necessary to simulate a full scenario.
